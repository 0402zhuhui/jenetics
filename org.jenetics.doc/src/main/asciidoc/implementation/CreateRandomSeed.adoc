== Creating random seeds

While implementing the http://jenetics.io/[Jenetics] library, I faced the problem of creating seed values for the Random engines I used. The usual way for doing this, is to take the current time stamp.

.Using timestamp as seed value
[source,java]
--------------
public static long seed() {
    return System.nanoTime();
}
--------------

To test the statistical quality for this kind of seed values, I treated it as *special* random engine and applied the http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php[dieharder] test suite to it. As you might expect, the quality of this random engine was    disastrous. It didn't pass a single *dieharder* test:

.Dieharder result for timestamp seed
