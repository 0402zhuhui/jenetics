/** 
 * <strong><p>Single point crossover</p></strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One or two children are created by taking two parent strings and cutting 
 * them at some randomly chosen site. E.g.
 * </p>
 * <div align="center">
 * 	<img src="doc-files/SinglePointCrossover.gif" >
 * </div>
 * <p>
 * If we create a child and its complement we preserving the total number of 
 * genes in the population, preventing any genetic drift.
 * Single-point crossover is the classic form of crossover. However, it produces
 * very slow mixing compared with multi-point crossover or uniform crossover. 
 * For problems where the site position has some intrinsic meaning to the 
 * problem single-point crossover can lead to small disruption than multi-point 
 * or uniform crossover.
