/**
 * In linear ranking selection, individuals (phenotypes) are sorted according
 * to their fitness values and the rank N is assignee to the best Phenotype 
 * individual and the rank 1 to the worst Phenotype. The selection probability 
 * is linearly assigned to the individuals according to their rank:<p/>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *        /             nplus - nminus          \
 *  p_i = | nminus + ------------------- (i - 1)| / N.
 *        \                N - 1                /
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Here nminus/N is the probability of the worst Phenotype individual to be 
 * selected and nplus/N the probability of the best Phenotype individual to be 
 * selected. As the population size is held constant, the conditions 
 * <code>nplus = 2 - nminus</code> and <code>nminus >= 0</code> must be 
 * fulfilled. Note that all individuals get a different rank, i.e., a different 
 * selection probability, even if the have the same fitness value. <p/>
