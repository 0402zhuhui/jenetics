/**
 * This class is for mutating a chromosomoes of an given population. There are 
 * two distinct roles mutation plays
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Exploring the search space. By making small moves mutation allows a
 * 	population to explore the search space. This exploration is often slow
 * 	compared to crossover, but in problems where crossover is disruptive this
 * 	can be an important way to explore the landscape.
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>Maintaining diversity. Mutation prevents a population from
 * 	correlating. Even if most of the search is being performed by crossover,
 * 	mutation can be vital to provide the diversity which crossover needs.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The mutation rate is the parameter that must be optimized. The optimal value 
 * of the mutation rate depends on the role mutation plays. If mutation is the 
 * only source of exploration (if there is no crossover) then the mutation rate 
 * should be set so that a reasonable neighbourhood of solutions is explored. 
 * Typically, this involves changing around one variable in the string, 
 * thus a mutation rate of 1/L is commonly used. Where L is the length of the
 * string, respectively the length of the 
 * {@link Chromosome#length()} or {@link Genotype}. 
 * That means, the probability that a given chromosome is mutate is
 * <pre>
 * 	probability/L,
 * </pre>
 * where the <code>probability</code> is the given mutation probability.
