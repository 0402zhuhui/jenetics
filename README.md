# Jenetics


Jenetics is an Genetic Algorithm, respectively an Evolutionary Algorithm, library written in Java. It is designed with a clear separation of the several  algorithm concepts, e. g. `Gene`, `Chromosome`, `Genotype`, `Phenotype`, `Population` and  fitness `Function`. Jenetics allows you to minimize or maximize the given fitness  function without tweaking it.


## Requirements

* Build time
+ **JDK 1.7**: The `JAVA_HOME` variable must be set to your java installation directory.
* Run time
+ **JScience** library, <http://jscience.org>: This library is included and lies in the `project/lib` directory.

## Build Jenetics


For building the Jenetics library from source, download the most recent, stable package version from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/jenetics/files/latest/download> and extract it to some build directory.

    $ unzip jenetics-<version>.zip -d <builddir>

<version> denotes the actual Jenetics version and `<builddir>` the actual build directory. Alternatively you can check out the latest-unstable-version from the Mercurial default branch.

    $ hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/jenetics/main <builddir>

Jenetics uses Gradle13 as build system and organizes the source into *sub*-projects (modules). Each sub-project is located in itâ€™s own sub-directory:


* **org.jenetics**: This project contains the source code and tests for the Jenetics core-module.
* **org.jenetics.example**: This project contains example code for the *core*-module.
* **org.jenetics.doc**: Contains the code of the web-site and the manual.

For building the library change into the `<builddir>` directory (or one of the module directory) and call one of the available tasks:

* **pack**: Compiles the sources of all modules, creates the JAR files and the Javadoc. The build artifacts are copied into the `<builddir>/build/package` directory. This task is only available in the `<builddir>` directory.
* **compileJava**: Compiles the Jenetics sources and copies the class files to the `<builddir>/<module-dir>/build/classes/main` directory.
* **test**: Compiles and executes the unit tests. The test results are printed onto the console and a test-report, created by TestNG, is written to `<builddir>/<module-dir>` directory.
* **javadoc**: Generates the API documentation. The Javadoc is stored in the `<builddir>/<module-dir>/build/docs` directory
* **jar**: Compiles the sources and creates the JAR files. The artifacts are copied to the `<builddir>/<module-dir>/build/libs` directory.
* **clean**: Deletes the `<builddir>/build/*` directories and removes all generated artifacts.

For packaging (building) the source call

    $ cd <build-dir>
    $ gradle pack



**IDE Integration**

Gradle has tasks which creates the project file for Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. Call

    $ gradle [eclipse|idea]

for creating the project files for Eclipse or IntelliJ, respectively.


## Coding standards

Beside the Java coding standards as given in <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html> the following extensions are used.

- All non-constant variables members start with underscore.
- Variable name for arrays or collections are plural.
- All helper classes which only contains static methods are lower-case. This  indicates that the given class can not be used as type, because no instance can be created.
