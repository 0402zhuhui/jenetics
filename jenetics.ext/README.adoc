= Module: `io.jenetics.ext`

This module contains additional algorithms, genes and chromosomes which are somehow _not standard_. The main reason for this division is the desire to keep the `io.jenetics.base` module as small as possible.


== Multi-objective optimization

The `io.jenetics.ext.moea` package contains classes and data structures, which allows the optimization of multi-object problems.

== Genes and chromosomes

* `BigIntegerGene`
* `BigIntegerChromosome`
* `TreeGene`
* `TreeChromosome`

== Operators

* `WeaselMutator`
* `WeaselSelector`
* `SimulatedBinaryCrossover`
* `SingleNodeCrossover`

== Util classes

* `Tree`: General tree implementation; needed for the `org.jenetics.prog` module.
