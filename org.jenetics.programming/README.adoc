# Genetic programming

The `io.jenetics.programming` module extends the Jenetics library with the possibility to do Genetic Programming. A program is represented by a tree (AST), as defined in the `io.jenetics.ext` module.

Lots of the features are left out. This is just a basic implementation. Future development will add missing features described in the literature.
